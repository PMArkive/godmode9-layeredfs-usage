###Using Lumas layeredfs (8.0+ or something, anything lower is unsupported)
Note: THIS IS NOT A SUBSTITUTION FOR SALTYSD FOR SSB4, STOP TRYING TO DO THAT FFS

1. Dump files that you wish to modify using https://pastebin.com/sx8HYULr (if you are provided files from say a rom hack, you can skip this and go to step 3)
2. Make changes as you see fit, I suggest that you make copies of files before modifying them and place them somewhere else.
3. Place files that you modified from the romfs into /luma/titles/titleid/romfs/. The titleid can be found in either FBI or by searching for it on 3dsdb.com
4. If you are using a rom hack that comes with a code.bin (or code.ips), place it in /luma/titles/titleid
5. Boot into luma's config (hold select on boot) and select "Enable Game Patching."
6. Launch the game and hope nothing crashes.
