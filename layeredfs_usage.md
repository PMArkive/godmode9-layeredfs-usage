### Using Lumas layeredfs (8.0+ or something, anything lower is unsupported)
**Note: THIS IS NOT A SUBSTITUTION FOR SALTYSD FOR SSB4, STOP TRYING TO DO THAT FFS**

1. Dump files that you wish to modify using [this]("https://github.com/knight-ryu12/godmode9-layeredfs-usage/blob/master/godmode9_cia_dumping_and_building.md") *(if you are provided files from say a rom hack, you can skip this and go to step 3)*
2. Make changes as you see. I suggest that you make copies of files before modifying them, and backup to your PC or Cloud.
3. Place files that you modified from the romfs into /luma/titles/titleid/romfs/. The titleid can be found in either FBI or by searching for it on [3DSDB]("http://www.3dsdb.com/")
4. If you are using a rom hack that comes with a code.bin (or code.ips), place it in /luma/titles/[titleid]
5. Boot into luma3DS config (hold select on boot) and select "Enable Game Patching."
6. Launch the game and hope nothing crashes.
