### Using Luma's layeredfs (Only version 8.0+)
**Note: THIS IS NOT A SUBSTITUTION FOR SALTYSD FOR SSB4*

1. Dump files that you wish to modify using [this](https://github.com/knight-ryu12/godmode9-layeredfs-usage/blob/master/godmode9_cia_dumping_and_building.md) *(if you are provided files from say a rom hack, you can skip this and go to step 3)*
2. Make changes as you see. I suggest that you make copies of files before modifying them, and backup to your PC or Cloud.
3. Place the modified files from romfs into /luma/titles/[titleid]/romfs/. The titleid can be found by using either FBI or searching for it on [3DSDB](http://www.3dsdb.com/)
4. If you are using a rom hack that comes with a code.bin (or code.ips), place it in /luma/titles/[titleid]. 
5. Boot into luma3DS config (hold select on boot) and select "Enable Game Patching."
6. Launch the game and hope nothing crashes.
